# Secureview Federal Credit Union SIEM Modernization

## Introduction

Welcome to the Secureview Federal Credit Union (SFCU) SIEM Modernization project! This repository contains the research and recommendations generated as part of our SPR400 course assignment at Seneca College.

## Project Overview

- **Evaluate**: Assess the current SIEM solution and its shortcomings.
- **Research**: Explore SIEM solutions in the market, focusing on LogRhythm, IBM QRadar, and Splunk.
- **Recommend**: Provide strategic recommendations for an upgraded SIEM solution tailored to SFCU's unique needs.
